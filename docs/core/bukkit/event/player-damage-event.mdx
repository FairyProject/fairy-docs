# Player Damage

This is straightforward, who wants to detect if the entity is a player every time? We provide a simple way that would save you time and effort.

---
## PlayerDamageEvent

A generic event that is triggered when a player is damaged, every damage event from a player will trigger this event.

```java
@EventHandler
public void onPlayerDamage(PlayerDamageEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    // Do something
}
```

---
## PlayerDamageByEntityEvent

An event that is triggered when a player is damaged by an entity.

:::warning

Only triggers when the damager is **NOT** a player or not indirectly damaged by a player. (projectile, etc.)

:::

```java
@EventHandler
public void onPlayerDamageByEntity(PlayerDamageByEntityEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    Entity damager = event.getDamager();
    // Do something
}
```

---
## PlayerDamageByPlayerEvent

An event that is triggered when a player is damaged by another player.

:::tip
