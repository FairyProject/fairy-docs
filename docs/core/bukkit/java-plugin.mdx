# JavaPlugin

You may be wondering, "Where is the JavaPlugin?"

Well, the JavaPlugin is a class that is used to create a plugin for the Minecraft server.
It is a part of the Bukkit API. But since Fairy has it own [Plugin](https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy/blob/v0.7/framework/platforms/core-platform/src/main/java/io/fairyproject/plugin/Plugin.java) instance, so you won't be able to use the JavaPlugin class directly.

Then where is it then? It is located in [BukkitPlugin](https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy/blob/v0.7/framework/bootstraps/bukkit-bootstrap/src/main/java/io/fairyproject/bootstrap/bukkit/BukkitPlugin.java) class, which is located in the Bukkit Bootstrap.
To access the JavaPlugin instance, you can use the following code:

```java
import io.fairyproject.bootstrap.bukkit.BukkitPlugin;

public class Test {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        JavaPlugin javaPlugin = BukkitPlugin.INSTANCE;

        // Do something with the JavaPlugin instance!
    }
}
```

That's easy, right?
