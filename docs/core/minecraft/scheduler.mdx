# MCScheduler

The scheduler module represents the Fairy module allowing users to schedule tasks in Minecraft. This feature is predominantly used in Minecraft plugins to schedule tasks to run at a specific time or to run tasks repeatedly.

To schedule a task in the next tick of main thread:
```java
import io.fairyproject.mc.scheduler.MCSchedulers;

public class Test {
    public void test() {
        MCSchedulers.getGlobalScheduler().schedule(() -> Log.info("I'm delayed by 1 tick!"), 1L);
    }
}
```

And yep! it's that simple, no more Java Plugins blah blah blah! ðŸ˜‚

## Scheduler Variants

So far MCSchedulers contains 4 variants of scheduler:
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="global" label="Global" default>
        ```java
        MCSchedulers.getGlobalScheduler()
        ```

        - **Bukkit**: The global scheduler is the main scheduler of the server, it schedules tasks to run in the main thread.
        - **Folia**: The global scheduler of folia server, it's not any region specific. mostly used for global things such as day-night cycle.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="async" label="Async">
        ```java
        MCSchedulers.getAsyncScheduler()
        ```

        - **Bukkit**: The async scheduler is used to schedule tasks to run in a separate thread.
        - **Folia**: The async scheduler is used to schedule tasks to run in a separate thread.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="entity" label="Entity">
        ```java
        MCSchedulers.getEntityScheduler(Object entity)
        ```

        - **Bukkit**: Automatically forward to main thread scheduler.
        - **Folia**: The entity scheduler is used to schedule tasks to run in the region of the entity.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="location" label="Location">
        ```java
        MCSchedulers.getLocationScheduler(Location location)
        MCSchedulers.getLocationScheduler(MCWorld world, int chunkX, int chunkZ)
        ```

        - **Bukkit**: Automatically forward to main thread scheduler.
        - **Folia**: The location scheduler is used to schedule tasks to run in the region of the location.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Scheduling Tasks

Everything returned in MCSchedulers is a MCScheduler, which is built on top of the Scheduler interface, it has the following methods:
- `ScheduledTask<?> schedule(Runnable task, long delay)`
    - Schedules a task to run after a delay, by ticks.
- `ScheduledTask<?> scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable task, long delay, long period)`
    - Schedules a task to run after a delay, and then repeatedly after a period, by ticks.
    - **The CompletableFuture of this will never end unless you manually cancelled it.**
- `<R> ScheduledTask<R> schedule(Callback<R> task, long delay)`
    - Schedules a task to run after a delay which potentially returns a value, by ticks.
- `<R> ScheduledTask<R> scheduleAtFixedRate(Callback<TaskResponse<R>> task, long delay, long period)`
    - Schedules a task to run after a delay, and then repeatedly after a period which potentially returns a value, by ticks.

Every task scheduled will return a ScheduledTask, which can be used to cancel the task or get the task's status by using [CompletableFuture](https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F8%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html).
For example:
```java
import io.fairyproject.mc.scheduler.MCSchedulers;

public class Test {
    public void test() {
        ScheduledTask<?> scheduledTask = MCSchedulers.getGlobalScheduler().schedule(() -> Log.info("I'm delayed by 20 ticks!"), 20L);
        scheduledTask.getFuture().thenAccept((v) -> Log.info("Task is done!"));
    }
}
```

The output will be:
```
I'm delayed by 20 ticks!
Task is done!
```

:::warning

If the task is cancelled then the Future will fail with a CancellationException.
If you want to handle the cancellation, you can use the whenComplete method of CompletableFuture.

:::

### Task with a return value
You can also use the scheduler to expect a return value from the task:
```java
import io.fairyproject.mc.scheduler.MCSchedulers;

public class Test {
    public void test() {
        ScheduledTask<Integer> scheduledTask = MCSchedulers.getGlobalScheduler().schedule(() -> {
            Log.info("I'm delayed by 20 ticks!");
            return 10;
        }, 20L);
        scheduledTask.getFuture().thenAccept((v) -> Log.info("Task is done! Result: " + v));
    }
}
```

The output will be:
```
I'm delayed by 20 ticks!
Task is done! Result: 10
```

### Repeated Task with a return value
And also, you can use the scheduler to run a task repeatedly that expects a return value:
```java
public class Test {
    public void test() {
        ScheduledTask<Player> scheduledTask = MCSchedulers.getGlobalScheduler().scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
            int size = Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers().size();
            Log.info("There are " + size + " players online!");

            if (size >= 10) {
                /**
                * If there are more than 10 players online, return the first player and the task will be stopped.
                */
                return TaskResponse.success(Bukkit.getOnlinePlayers().iterator().next());
            } else if (size == 0) {
                /**
                * If there are no players online, return a failure and the task will be stopped.
                */
                return TaskResponse.failure("No players online!");
            }

            /**
            * If there are less than 10 players online, continue the task.
            */
            return TaskResponse.continueTask();
        }, 20L, 10L);

        scheduledTask.getFuture().whenComplete((v, e) -> {
            if (e != null) {
                Log.error("Task failed!", e);
            } else {
                Log.info("Task is done! Result: " + v);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This logic is a bit more complex! let's break it down:
- The task will run every 10 ticks.
- It will check the number of online players.
- If there are more than 10 players online, it will return the first player and the task will be stopped.
- If there are no players online, it will return a failure and the task will be stopped.
- If there are less than 10 players online, it will continue the task.

So this will act like a monitor that checks online players, it will cycle forever unless there is no player online or there are more than 10 players online.

When no player:
```
There are 0 players online!
Task failed! java.lang.IllegalStateException: No players online!
```

When more than 10 players:
```
There are 11 players online!
Task is done! Result: Player{name='Player1'}
```

When less than 10 players:
```
There are 9 players online!
There are 8 players online!
There are 7 players online!
...
```

## Cancelling a task

You can cancel a task by using the `cancel` method of the ScheduledTask:
```java
import io.fairyproject.mc.scheduler.MCSchedulers;

public class Test {
    public void test() {
        ScheduledTask<?> scheduledTask = MCSchedulers.getGlobalScheduler().schedule(() -> Log.info("I'm delayed by 20 ticks!"), 20L);
        scheduledTask.cancel();
    }
}
```

And the task will be cancelled before it runs!
