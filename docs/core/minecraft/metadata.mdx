# MCMetadata

If you read the [Metadata](/core/metadata) page, you know you can introduce MetaRegistry to reference MetaStorage instances by the object identifier.
But isn't it still a hassle? ðŸ¤” If I want to get the metadata of the player, I need to code a registry, and get the MetaStorage instance from the MetaRegistry, then finally get the metadata from the MetaStorage.

No worries! Fairy has it covered for you! ðŸŽ‰

## Metadata for Minecraft

Fairy has a built-in metadata system for Minecraft plugins. You can access the metadata of the player, world, entity, blocks etc. predefined registries by Fairy.

With the class **`io.fairyproject.mc.data.MCMetadata`**, you can access the metadata for anything in Minecraft.
Here's an example of using the metadata system in Minecraft:

```java
import io.fairyproject.mc.data.MCMetadata;

public class Test {
    public void test() {
        // Get it directly from MCPlayer / bukkit Player!
        MetaStorage bukkitPlayerStorage = MCMetadata.provide(player);

        bukkitPlayerStorage.set(MyMetaKeys.MY_KEY, "Hello, Fairy!");
        bukkitPlayerStorage.get(MyMetaKeys.MY_KEY);

        // Or get it from the MCWorld / bukkit World!
        MetaStorage bukkitWorldStorage = MCMetadata.provide(world);
        // Or MCEntity / bukkit Entity!
        MetaStorage bukkitEntityStorage = MCMetadata.provide(entity);
        // Or BlockPosition / Block!
        MetaStorage bukkitBlockStorage = MCMetadata.provide(block);
        // Or from player UUID!
        MetaStorage bukkitPlayerStorage = MCMetadata.providePlayer(player.getUniqueID());
    }
}
```

And tada! You can access the metadata of the player, world, entity, blocks etc. without the need to code a registry for each object.

:::info

The metadata registry won't unregister the metadata when the object is removed from the world.
You need to manually remove the metadata from the storage whenever needed.
